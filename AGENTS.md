# AGENTS.md — neo4j-skills

## Feedback Commands

No build/test system exists yet (test harness is a future task). Once tests/harness/ is built:
- Run tests: `python tests/harness/runner.py --cases tests/cases/ --skill neo4j-cypher-authoring-skill`
- Lint YAML: `yamllint .github/workflows/`

## Conventions

- Skill directories: `neo4j-<name>-skill/` containing `SKILL.md`, optional `references/`, `VERSION`
- L3 reference files live in `neo4j-cypher-authoring-skill/references/` organized by category:
  - `references/read/` — patterns, functions, read subqueries (COUNT/COLLECT/EXISTS/CALL), types-and-nulls
  - `references/write/` — CALL IN TRANSACTIONS, bulk writes
  - `references/schema/` — indexes, constraints, DDL
  - `references/` root — style-guide (cross-cutting)
- Scripts live in `scripts/`
- Test harness lives in `tests/harness/`, test cases in `tests/cases/`

## Submodule Notes

- `docs-cypher` → `git@github.com:neo4j/docs-cypher.git` pinned to `2026.01.0`
- `docs-cheat-sheet` → `git@github.com:neo4j/docs-cheat-sheet.git` pinned to `2026.02.0`
- Tag naming convention: `YYYY.MM.PATCH` (e.g. `2026.01.0`)
- After cloning: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Gotchas

- Both docs repos were originally plain cloned directories (untracked). Used `git submodule add --force` to convert without losing data.
- docs-cheat-sheet is on a newer tag (2026.02.0) than docs-cypher (2026.01.0) — update both together when pinning to new releases.
- GQL-excluded clauses: LET, FINISH, FILTER, NEXT, INSERT — strip these from all L3 reference files.
- CYPHER 25 pragma: every generated query must begin with `CYPHER 25`.
- Asciidoc `[source, role=noheader]` has no language tag — guard against capturing `role` as the language identifier.
- Asciidoc source block language tracking: set `pending_source_lang` when `[source, lang]` is seen, consume it when `----` is encountered (not via lookback into output_lines).
- Submodule SHA detection: `docs-cypher/modules/ROOT/pages` is 3 parents up from the submodule root (`pages` → `ROOT` → `modules` → `docs-cypher`).
- Token budget: reserve ~20 tokens headroom for the truncation notice itself.
- L3 reference files for docs-cypher are better authored manually, not auto-extracted: source docs are verbose (setup graphs, narrative prose) and hit the token budget before covering all required content. The extraction script is better suited for docs-cheat-sheet which is already concise.
- DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS and REPEATABLE ELEMENTS match modes only available since Neo4j 2025.06 / Cypher 25. REPEATABLE ELEMENTS requires bounded quantifiers (no +, *, {1,}).
- `SHORTEST` keyword replaces deprecated `shortestPath()` / `allShortestPaths()` functions in Cypher 25.
- `id()` is deprecated — prefer `elementId()` which returns a `STRING` stable only within a single transaction.
- `vector()` constructor is new in Neo4j 2025.10; `vector.similarity.cosine()` and `vector.similarity.euclidean()` existed before.
- Aggregating functions: `collect(null)` → `[]` (empty list), `count(null)` → `0`, `sum(null)` → `0`; all others → `null` when all inputs are null.
- `SEARCH` clause (Neo4j 2026.01+, Preview) is **vector-only** — fulltext indexes still use `db.index.fulltext.queryNodes()` procedure. The SEARCH clause does not cover fulltext indexes.
- Vector index `OPTIONS` map is **mandatory** — `vector.dimensions` and `vector.similarity_function` are required at creation time.
- `USING INDEX SEEK` forces index seek (not scan); `USING SCAN` forces label scan with no index — opposite of intent, so use `USING SCAN` only to deliberately avoid indexes.
- Index `state` values: `ONLINE` (usable), `POPULATING` (building — check `populationPercent`), `FAILED`.
- `CALL { ... } IN TRANSACTIONS` is only allowed in implicit transactions — not inside explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` blocks. Batching applies to input rows fed *outside* the subquery; matching inside the subquery collapses to one transaction.
- `COUNT {}` vs `count()`: `COUNT { pattern }` is a subquery counting rows; `count(expr)` is an aggregating function. They are not interchangeable — `count()` must appear in a clause that has an aggregation context.
- CALL subquery scope clause (`CALL (x, y) { }`) is Cypher 25 standard; importing `WITH` as first clause inside CALL is deprecated. Use `CALL ()` for isolated, `CALL (*)` for all-vars, `CALL (x)` for specific imports.
- Type predicates: `IS :: TYPE` returns `true` for `null` by default (all types include null). Append `NOT NULL` to exclude null: `x IS :: INTEGER NOT NULL`. Negation `IS NOT ::` returns `false` for null by default.
- Closed Dynamic Unions: `val IS :: INTEGER | FLOAT` tests multiple types; all inner types must have same nullability (all nullable or all `NOT NULL`).
- Casting: base functions (`toFloat`, `toInteger`, etc.) throw on unconvertible input; `OrNull` variants (`toFloatOrNull`, etc.) return `null` instead — prefer OrNull in agent-authored queries to avoid runtime errors.
- `null = null` → `null` (not `true`); `null <> null` → `null`. Always use `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`.
- Style guide keyword list (keywords.adoc) is 400 items — useless for agents. What agents need: UPPERCASE for clauses/operators, camelCase for functions, lowercase for `null`/`true`/`false`. Document this as a casing rules table, not a keyword enumeration.

## Scripts

- `scripts/extract-references.py` — extract asciidoc → Markdown for L3 reference files. Run with `--dry-run` to preview without writing.
- `scripts/test-extract-references.py` — test suite for extract-references.py. Run from repo root: `python3 scripts/test-extract-references.py`

### extract-references.py — Hybrid Workflow

The script generates **first drafts** for L3 reference files (not final output). After generation, manually curate to improve density and accuracy. Then re-run the script only when submodule pins change.

**Key behaviors:**
- `skip_preamble=True` per source: strips everything before the first `==` section (level-2+ heading), not just the title. Critical for docs-cypher pages which have verbose intro paragraphs.
- `max_code_blocks=N` per source: limits code blocks per file (set 1–3 for docs-cypher, 0 for cheat-sheet inline files).
- `////` comment blocks stripped (test-setup CREATEs in cheat-sheet are wrapped in `////`).
- `[source, ..., role=test-setup]` blocks skipped entirely (no output).
- `[source, role="queryresult"...]` tables skipped (result output tables).
- `// tag::name[]` / `// end::name[]` markers stripped (inline tag delimiters in docs-cypher).
- `[.description]`, `[%collapsible]`, `[options=...]` annotations stripped.
- `|====` (4-sign) tables handled in addition to `|===` (3-sign).
- `include::` directives resolved locally: `{attr}/docs-cypher/.../pages/PATH` → `cypher_src/PATH`; tag-filtered sections extracted.

**Cheat-sheet files and includes:** Only ~44/101 cheat-sheet pages have inline content; the rest use `include::` that reference docs-cypher by tag. Both cases now work: inline content is extracted directly, include-based content resolves to the tagged section in docs-cypher.

**Config ordering:** Put cheat-sheet inline sources first in EXTRACTION_CONFIGS so truncation preserves the most concise content.

**GH Action update workflow:** When bumping a submodule pin (e.g., docs-cypher 2026.01.0 → 2026.02.0), run `python3 scripts/extract-references.py` to regenerate all L3 drafts, inspect `git diff` on the generated files, manually curate any sections that degraded, and commit. No diff-based update plan needed — full regeneration is idempotent and fast.

## SKILL.md Authoring Notes

- SKILL.md line budget is 300 lines (not 300 non-blank lines). Inline `CYPHER 25` on the same line as each query to save ~10 lines in the Schema-First Protocol section.
- Verified with: `wc -l SKILL.md` (lines) + `python3 -c "words=len(text.split()); print(int(words*1.3))"` (token estimate).
- task-020 (WebFetch proactive framing) was folded into task-010's SKILL.md — the proactive framing is already present. task-020 can be marked as superseded or trivially completed.
- SEARCH clause (Neo4j 2026.01 Preview) is **vector-only** — always document the fulltext procedure fallback alongside it.
