# PRD: neo4j-cypher-authoring-skill

**Status**: Draft
**Author**: Design session 2026-03-19
**Target**: Autonomous AI agents writing Cypher for Neo4j 2025.x / 2026.x

---

## Overview

A new Agent Skill that enables autonomous AI agents to write, optimize, and validate Cypher 25 queries for Neo4j 2025.x and 2026.x databases. No such skill currently exists — the existing `neo4j-cypher-skill` covers only migration (upgrading 4.x/5.x queries).

Without this skill agents produce:
- Queries missing the `CYPHER 25` version pragma, causing unintended Cypher 5 execution
- Full label scans and Cartesian products from skipping schema inspection
- Incorrect quantified path expression syntax (too new for model training data)
- `MERGE` without `ON CREATE SET` / `ON MATCH SET`, corrupting data on re-runs
- Inline literals instead of `$params`, breaking plan caching and introducing injection risk
- Silent failures on 0-result queries with no recovery logic

The skill follows the Agent Skills progressive disclosure model (L1 metadata → L2 SKILL.md → L3 reference files → WebFetch escalation) and includes a companion test harness that validates output against real Neo4j databases.

---

## Goals

1. Produce correct, index-aware Cypher 25 queries on first attempt for the common 80% case
2. Self-validate via `EXPLAIN` / `PROFILE` and recover from performance issues without human input
3. Apply schema-first discipline (inspect before writing) as a mandatory, non-skippable protocol
4. Cover all Cypher 25 syntax: SEARCH, MATCH modes, WHEN, quantified path expressions, subqueries
5. Enforce `$param` discipline (never inline literals) for plan caching and injection safety
6. Provide 5-tier knowledge escalation: training data → L2 inline → L3 references → manual clause pages → full cheat sheet
7. Stay maintainable: L3 reference files auto-regenerated from upstream asciidoc on each Neo4j release via GH Action
8. Be testable: a companion test harness validates skill output against real Neo4j databases
9. Generate a reusable training dataset from validated queries: human-readable YAML records pairing questions with verified Cypher, schema context, and performance metadata — usable for fine-tuning, few-shot prompting, and as an example store
10. WebFetch to Neo4j Cypher docs is always available to online agents — SKILL.md must frame it as a proactive first-class option, not a last resort, especially when L3 reference files are token-budget-truncated
11. Enable early pre-filtering: SKILL.md must categorize query patterns into READ / WRITE / ADMIN buckets so agents can determine at L2 which L3 folder is relevant, loading only the files they need rather than all of them

---

## Non-Goals

- Driver code generation → covered by `neo4j-migration-skill`
- Database administration (SHOW DATABASES, ALTER USER, privileges) → covered by `neo4j-cli-tools-skill`
- Cypher 4.x / 5.x migration → covered by `neo4j-cypher-skill`

### Excluded GQL Clauses

The following GQL-influenced clauses are excluded from all skill content — they are syntactic rewrites that add confusion without value:

| Excluded | Pure Cypher Equivalent |
|---|---|
| `INSERT` | `CREATE` |
| `FILTER` | `WHERE` |
| `FINISH` | `RETURN` (without output) |
| `LET` | `WITH` (variable assignment) |
| `NEXT` | Sequential composed queries |

Kept GQL-origin features (add real value, not just renames): `WHEN` (conditional dispatch), `SEARCH` clause (vector/fulltext), MATCH modes (`DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS`, `REPEATABLE ELEMENTS`, `ANY`, `ALL`), quantified path expressions (`{m,n}`, `+`, `*`).

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- REQ-F-001: SKILL.md must always instruct agents to emit `CYPHER 25` as the first token of every generated query
- REQ-F-002: SKILL.md must define a mandatory schema-first protocol — agents must inspect schema before writing any MATCH clause using: `db.schema.visualization()`, `SHOW INDEXES`, `SHOW CONSTRAINTS`, and either `apoc.meta.schema()` (preferred, fast) or `db.schema.nodeTypeProperties()` + `db.schema.relTypeProperties()` (fallback when APOC absent); APOC availability detected via `SHOW PROCEDURES WHERE name = 'apoc.meta.schema'`
- REQ-F-003: SKILL.md must enforce `$param` syntax for all predicates and MERGE keys — never inline string or integer literals (exception: LIMIT with literal integer)
- REQ-F-004: SKILL.md must define a self-validation loop: generate → `EXPLAIN` (check for AllNodesScan / CartesianProduct) → rewrite if needed → `PROFILE` (record dbHits, rows, allocatedMemory, elapsedTimeMs)
- REQ-F-005: SKILL.md must define failure recovery decision trees for: 0-result queries, TypeErrors, and query timeouts — no human escalation required
- REQ-F-006: SKILL.md must include inline core patterns for: MERGE safety (`ON CREATE SET` / `ON MATCH SET`), quantified path expressions, WITH cardinality reset, WHEN conditional queries, SEARCH clause (vector + fulltext)
- REQ-F-007: SKILL.md must include a deprecated syntax → Cypher 25 preferred mapping table covering: old variable-length paths (`[:REL*1..5]` → `{1,5}`), `shortestPath()` → `SHORTEST 1`, `allShortestPaths()` → `ALL SHORTEST`
- REQ-F-008: SKILL.md must include a query construction decision tree that selects the correct L3 reference file based on query type
- REQ-F-009: SKILL.md must include WebFetch escalation logic with specific manual page URL patterns and the cheat sheet URL
- REQ-F-010: SKILL.md must include `FOREACH` vs `UNWIND` decision rule and brief `USE` clause guidance for multi-database routing
- REQ-F-011: Six L3 reference files must be created, each generated from upstream asciidoc sources: `cypher25-patterns.md`, `cypher25-functions.md`, `cypher25-indexes.md`, `cypher25-subqueries.md`, `cypher25-types-and-nulls.md`, `cypher-style-guide.md`
- REQ-F-012: `cypher25-indexes.md` must include an index type selection table mapping query predicates to required index types (RANGE, TEXT, POINT, FULLTEXT, VECTOR)
- REQ-F-013: `cypher25-types-and-nulls.md` must cover null propagation rules, explicit null guards, type casting functions, and type predicate expressions
- REQ-F-014: An extraction script (`skill-generation-validation-tools/scripts/extract-references.py`) must generate all L3 files from `docs-cypher/` and `docs-cheat-sheet/` with configurable GQL exclusion list, max-tokens enforcement per file, and detection of missing expected sections
- REQ-F-015: `docs-cypher/` and `docs-cheat-sheet/` must be converted from plain directories to git submodules, pinned to the current Neo4j 25 / 2026.x release tag
- REQ-F-016: A GH Action (`.github/workflows/update-cypher-skill.yml`) must run monthly, detect upstream doc changes, regenerate L3 files, update the `VERSION` file, and create a PR with diff stat, changelog summary, and a `breaking-change` label when expected sections are missing
- REQ-F-017: A test harness (`skill-generation-validation-tools/tests/harness/`) must validate skill output against real Neo4j databases with four gates: syntax (EXPLAIN), correctness (row count), quality (deprecated operator / syntax detection), and performance (PROFILE metrics)
- REQ-F-018: A question generator (`skill-generation-validation-tools/tests/harness/generator.py`) must sample property values using `COLLECT { MATCH ... RETURN DISTINCT ... LIMIT 100 }` subqueries (not `collect()[..N]`), infer property semantics, generate questions via Claude API, auto-execute candidate Cypher to capture observed baselines, and produce YAML test stubs with tolerance-multiplied thresholds for human review
- REQ-F-019: A `VERSION` file at the skill root must record neo4j version, cypher version, submodule commit SHAs, and generation date; updated by the GH Action on each release
- REQ-F-020: SKILL.md must explicitly instruct online agents that WebFetch to Neo4j Cypher docs is always available and should be used proactively — not just as a last resort — framing it as a first-class knowledge source at the same level as L3 reference files; the instruction must note that L3 files may be token-budget-truncated and WebFetch fills the gap
- REQ-F-021: A training dataset exporter (`skill-generation-validation-tools/tests/harness/exporter.py`) must write YAML records for every test case that passes all four validation gates; each record must include: `id`, `question`, `database`, `neo4j_version`, `schema_context` (full schema inspection output), `property_samples` (sampled values per label/property), `cypher` (the validated query), and `metadata` (difficulty, tags, db_hits, allocated_memory_bytes, runtime_ms, passed_gates)
- REQ-F-022: A converter script (`skill-generation-validation-tools/scripts/to_jsonl.py`) must transform the YAML training dataset into JSONL format compatible with Anthropic and OpenAI fine-tuning APIs, with each line containing a system/user/assistant message triple where: system = skill instructions, user = question + schema context, assistant = validated Cypher query
- REQ-F-023: SKILL.md must include an explicit READ / WRITE / SCHEMA / ADMIN query categorization section in the Query Construction Decision Tree, defining: READ (MATCH, OPTIONAL MATCH, CALL subqueries, WITH, RETURN, aggregations, COLLECT/COUNT/EXISTS subquery expressions, SEARCH), WRITE (CREATE, MERGE, SET, REMOVE, DELETE, DETACH DELETE, CALL IN TRANSACTIONS, FOREACH, LOAD CSV), SCHEMA (CREATE/DROP INDEX, CREATE/DROP CONSTRAINT, SHOW INDEXES, SHOW CONSTRAINTS, SHOW PROCEDURES), ADMIN (CREATE/DROP DATABASE, ALTER USER, roles/privileges, SHOW TRANSACTIONS, SHOW SERVERS). The section must instruct agents to determine the category first and then load only the relevant L3 references folder, not all files
- REQ-F-024: The L3 reference file folder structure must enforce the four-way split: `references/read/` for read-only query constructs, `references/write/` for write/mutation constructs, `references/schema/` for index/constraint/DDL schema operations, `references/admin/` for database administration (users, roles, databases, transactions), and `references/` root for cross-cutting guides (e.g. style-guide). When a topic spans categories (e.g. CALL subquery for reads vs CALL IN TRANSACTIONS for writes), files must be split and placed in the correct folder. This structure must be documented in `references/README.md`
- REQ-F-025: A harness result analysis script (`skill-generation-validation-tools/scripts/analyze-results.py`) must read one or more harness JSON result files and produce a structured Markdown improvement report containing: (a) failure summary grouped by gate, difficulty tier, and tag cluster; (b) inferred SKILL.md sections most likely responsible for each failure pattern (schema-first, QPE, MERGE safety, null handling, subquery scope, type casting, etc.); (c) concrete recommended edits with before/after Cypher examples where possible. Output is for human review — the script does not patch SKILL.md automatically.
- REQ-F-026: Test cases for the `recommendations` domain (`demo.neo4jlabs.com`, credentials: `recommendations/recommendations`, database: `recommendations`) must cover ≥ 25 cases across basic, intermediate, advanced, complex, and expert difficulty tiers, exercising: bipartite graph traversal (User→Movie rating patterns), top-N recommendation queries (ORDER BY rating DESC, LIMIT), collaborative filtering via common neighbor counting, rating aggregation (avg, count, stddev), COLLECT subquery for genre/actor collections, OPTIONAL MATCH for sparse rating graphs, and vector similarity via any vector index present in the schema.
- REQ-F-027: Test cases for the `ucfraud` domain must cover ≥ 25 cases across basic, intermediate, advanced, complex, and expert difficulty tiers. The primary target database is a local Neo4j 2026.02.1 instance (`bolt://localhost`, credentials: `neo4j/password`, database: `ucfraud`) which is writeable and runs the full feature set including the GA `SEARCH` clause. Cases must exercise: fraud ring detection via quantified path expressions (QPE `{2,5}`), transaction graph traversal (Account→Transaction→Merchant multi-hop), temporal fraud patterns using date/datetime functions and duration comparisons, SHORTEST path variants for tracing money flow, multi-hop relationship traversal for ring detection, SEARCH clause with fulltext and/or vector indexes, and CALL IN TRANSACTIONS batch flagging patterns (write queries marked `is_write_query: true` — valid on the local writable instance).
- REQ-F-028: An "expert" difficulty tier must be defined in the test harness above "complex". Expert cases must exercise: multi-database `USE` clause routing, hybrid fulltext+vector re-ranking in a single query pipeline using the GA `SEARCH` clause (available in Neo4j 2026.02.1), CALL IN TRANSACTIONS with ON ERROR CONTINUE/BREAK for batch operations, ALL SHORTEST / SHORTEST k path enumeration, and deeply nested QPEs with bounded quantifiers (`{m,n}` not `+`). At least 5 expert cases must be added to each domain case file (companies, recommendations, ucfraud).
- REQ-F-029: The `SEARCH` clause (GA in Neo4j 2026.02.1, no longer Preview) must be exercised in test cases against the local 2026.02.1 instance. The ucfraud domain case file must include at least 2 cases using `SEARCH ... USING FULLTEXT INDEX` or `SEARCH ... USING VECTOR INDEX` syntax. SKILL.md must be updated to note that the SEARCH clause is GA as of Neo4j 2026.02.1 (was Preview in 2026.01) and that the fulltext procedure fallback (`db.index.fulltext.queryNodes`) remains necessary only for pre-2026.02 databases.
- REQ-F-030: A structured `dataset:` section must be present at the top of every domain YAML case file (companies.yml, recommendations.yml, ucfraud.yml). It must include: `name`, `database`, `connection` (uri, username), `description` (business-language summary of the dataset), `schema` (nodes with typed properties including optional min/max/sample/values fields, relationships with from/to direction and optional properties, indexes with type and call example), and `notes` (key constraints and caveats). This is the canonical schema source — agents and the harness use this directly, no separate schema files required.
- REQ-F-031: SKILL.md must include a mandatory "MUST VALIDATE: Schema Fidelity" section instructing agents to verify every label, relationship type, property name, and index name in a generated query against the provided schema before returning. It must include a validation checklist table and a vocabulary discipline table mapping common business terms to their correct schema counterparts. Schema validation is mandatory when schema context is present in the prompt.
- REQ-F-032: SKILL.md must define a dual output format: every generated query must be returned as a `\`\`\`yaml` block containing `query_literals` (with literal values, directly executable), `query_parametrized` (with `$param` placeholders), and `parameters` (map of param name → value). A `\`\`\`cypher` block with the literal query may also be included for quick reference. The `$param` / YAML-key output format is an internal implementation detail and must never be surfaced to the end user in elicitations or explanatory comments.
- REQ-F-033: SKILL.md must include a "Value Normalization and Domain Translation" section with four rules: (1) when schema provides `values:` or `sample:` entries, translate user-supplied values to the nearest matching stored value and comment the translation; (2) validate numeric inputs against schema `min:`/`max:` ranges and elicit clarification on out-of-range values exceeding an order of magnitude; (3) recognize ID patterns from observed samples and normalize user input to match; (4) when schema provides no values/samples, apply common-sense normalization to user input and elicit only when the information is genuinely insufficient to generate a query.
- REQ-F-034: The test harness runner must inject schema context (from the `dataset:` section) and value hints (sample/enum/range data per property) into every Claude prompt. `_collect_value_hints()` must extract this data and prepend a "REPRESENTATIVE DATA VALUES" block so the model uses real entity names, IDs, and codes rather than generic placeholders. Value hint fields (`values:`, `sample:`, `min:`, `max:`) are optional — the runner must handle their absence gracefully.
- REQ-F-035: Each domain case file must include a set of value-enriched test questions that use concrete entity names, enum values, and ranges drawn from the `dataset:` schema rather than generic placeholders. A subset (≤ 30%) of questions per domain must be phrased in casual business-user language that requires the skill to perform value translation (e.g., "show me all flagged accounts" rather than "MATCH where status='flagged'"; "which high-severity alerts are still open" rather than "severity='high' AND status='open'"). These questions test the skill's value normalization and vocabulary translation capability without replacing the majority of existing technical test cases.
- REQ-F-036: The test harness runner must support parallel test case execution via a `--workers N` flag (default 1 for serial). When N > 1, cases are dispatched concurrently to up to N Claude Code processes. Each case still runs independently (no shared state). Database connections must be pooled or created per-worker. The implementation must prevent garbled stdout by buffering per-case output and flushing atomically after each case completes. Worker count should not exceed the number of available cases.
- REQ-F-037: Following each harness run, a critical skill review must be performed combining: (a) the improvement report from analyze-results.py mapping failures to SKILL.md sections; (b) general skill design principles (progressive disclosure, token budget, actionability of rules); (c) best-practice comparisons against similar AI coding agent skills. The review must produce prioritized SKILL.md edits with before/after examples and be committed as a named revision. Target: close gaps identified in the per-difficulty pass rate analysis against PRD thresholds (REQ-NF-004 through REQ-NF-011).
- REQ-F-039: SKILL.md must include a curated set of negative examples — explicit "DO NOT write" patterns with annotated explanations — to counteract stale assumptions baked into the model from training data on older Cypher versions. The evaluation must determine: (a) which patterns the model persistently generates despite contradicting SKILL.md rules (identified from harness failures across multiple runs); (b) which patterns arise from outdated Cypher training data (deprecated syntax like `[:REL*]`, `shortestPath()`, importing-WITH in CALL, label-free MATCH, multi-property MERGE); (c) how to encode negative examples most effectively (inline DO-NOT blocks, annotated bad→good rewrites, comment warnings). The output is a prioritised list of negative examples added to SKILL.md and/or L3 reference files. A follow-up harness run must confirm that the targeted failure patterns decrease.
- REQ-F-040: SKILL.md MERGE Safety guidance must enforce three rules: (1) MERGE a node using only its constrained key property(ies) in the pattern — never include non-key properties; (2) MERGE a relationship only after both its start and end nodes are already bound via a prior MATCH or MERGE — never use unbound endpoints; (3) every MERGE must include both `ON CREATE SET` and `ON MATCH SET` sub-clauses. Violations of any of these three rules are considered SKILL.md compliance failures.
- REQ-F-041: Test case data integrity — for each domain YAML, every test case that specifies a concrete entity name, ID, enum value, or exact string literal in its question or notes must be verified to produce `actual_rows >= min_results` against the live database. Cases that return 0 rows due to stale or non-existent entity references must be updated with verified values from the DB (via live query or schema sampling). Affected domains identified by validation run: goodreads (book titles), legalcontracts (party names, contract types), retail (customer IDs, article labels), northwind (product availability). Each corrected case must be re-run to confirm it passes Gate 2.
- REQ-F-042: `write/cypher25-gds.md` must document that GDS algorithm results are **streaming-only by default** — algorithm procedures like `gds.louvain.stream()` return rows for the duration of the call only; properties such as `node.louvainCommunity` do NOT exist on the node unless a write-back step (`gds.louvain.write()`) has been explicitly executed. SKILL.md must include a note in the GDS section: never assume GDS-computed properties are stored unless schema context confirms `gds_write_back: true` or equivalent. The negative example `WHERE node.louvainCommunity IS NOT NULL` (without a prior write step) must be added to the DO-NOT list.
- REQ-F-043: The Gate 1 validator (`validator.py`) must not incorrectly flag valid GRAPH TYPE DDL statements (`ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE`, `SHOW GRAPH TYPES`, `CREATE GRAPH TYPE`) as syntax errors. If `ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE ADD { ... }` is currently blocked by a Gate 1 regex, add a whitelist entry or adjust the check. Gate 1 should only reject GQL-only aliases (`LET`, `FINISH`, `FILTER`, `INSERT`, bare `NEXT`) — not valid Neo4j Enterprise DDL.
- REQ-F-044: Fix test case `companies-expert-002` (and any similar cases in other domains) where a fulltext index is used with an incorrect target label. The `entity` fulltext index in the companies domain is defined on `Organization(name)` — not on `Article`. Any test case or generated query that calls `db.index.fulltext.queryNodes('entity', ...)` and then filters by `WHERE node:Article` will return 0 rows. The test case must be rewritten to use the correct index for the intended label, or to use a vector search on `Chunk` for article-content queries.
- REQ-F-045: SKILL.md and a new or updated L3 reference file must document the Neo4j **parallel runtime** for compute-intensive analytics queries. Content must cover: (1) the runtime hint syntax (`CYPHER runtime=parallel MATCH ...`); (2) query types that benefit (full graph scans, aggregations, graph algorithms without GDS); (3) version availability and edition requirements; (4) when NOT to use it (OLTP queries, short-hop lookups, write queries); (5) interaction with `PROFILE` for confirming parallel plan selection. A routing entry must be added to SKILL.md's decision tree.
- REQ-F-046: The test harness runner (`runner.py`) and schema generator (`generator.py`) must support a `--model` flag accepting `sonnet`, `haiku`, or `opus` (default: `sonnet`). The flag maps to the full model ID passed via `--model <id>` to the `claude --print` subprocess. Makefile targets must expose this as a `MODEL=` variable (e.g. `make run-all MODEL=haiku`). Default behaviour is unchanged — omitting `--model` continues to use `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- REQ-F-048: A self-service **dataset registration CLI** (`make register-dataset`) must allow any user to onboard a new or existing Neo4j database without writing YAML by hand. The tool accepts `DB_URI=`, `DB_USER=`, `DB_PASS=`, `DB_NAME=`, `DOMAIN=` (derived from DB_NAME if omitted), and `MODEL=` (default: sonnet) Makefile variables. It auto-discovers: (a) Neo4j version via `CALL dbms.components()`; (b) available capabilities via `SHOW PROCEDURES YIELD name WHERE name STARTS WITH $prefix` for `gds.`, `apoc.`, `ai.` prefixes; (c) full schema via `CALL apoc.meta.schema()` with fallback to `CALL db.schema.visualization()`; (d) representative property values per node label via `COLLECT { MATCH (n:Label) RETURN DISTINCT n.prop LIMIT 20 }` sampling; (e) index and constraint inventory via `SHOW INDEXES` / `SHOW CONSTRAINTS`. After discovery it calls Claude (with `--model $MODEL`) to generate a human-readable `description:` and per-label `notes:` (business context, key entities, notable relationships). Output is a complete `dataset:` YAML block written to `tests/cases/<domain>.yml` — creating the file if new, or updating the `dataset:` section in-place if the file already exists. The generated file is immediately usable with `make generate-questions`.
- REQ-F-049: A self-service **question generation CLI** (`make generate-questions`) must generate N business-level test case questions for an existing domain YAML (which must already contain a `dataset:` block). Accepts `DOMAIN=`, `COUNT=` (default 25), `MODEL=` (default sonnet), `DIFFICULTIES=` (default all five tiers, comma-separated). For each question it: (1) generates a business-user-language question using schema, sampled values, and description as context (no graph labels/rel-types/Cypher in the question text); (2) generates a candidate Cypher query; (3) auto-executes the query against the live DB to capture `min_results` baseline and `execution_ms`; (4) writes the validated case stub to the domain YAML with a new sequential ID. Cases are appended without duplicating existing IDs. Failed auto-execution (0 rows or error) produces a stub marked `status: needs_review` rather than being silently dropped. A `make onboard-dataset` composite target runs `register-dataset` then `generate-questions` in sequence for full zero-to-cases onboarding. All targets must work from the repo root and delegate to the `skill-generation-validation-tools/` Python tooling via `uv run`.
- REQ-F-050: All question generation tooling (both `generate_questions.py` and the existing `generator.py`) must include a **business-domain language validator** that runs on every generated question before it is written to the domain YAML. The validator must reject questions containing: graph node labels (words matching `:UpperCase` pattern or known schema labels), relationship type names (ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES patterns or known schema rel-types), Cypher keywords (`MATCH`, `WHERE`, `RETURN`, `WITH`, `CALL`, `MERGE`, `CREATE`, `DELETE`, `SET`, `UNION`, `EXISTS`, `COUNT`, `COLLECT`, `LIMIT`, `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`), property dot-access syntax (`word.property` patterns), procedure/function names (`gds.`, `apoc.`, `db.index`, `ai.`), and index/procedure technical names from the domain schema. Rejected questions must be automatically rewritten by calling Claude once with an explicit "rewrite as a casual business-user question" instruction; if the rewrite still fails validation, the case is written with `status: needs_review` and a `validation_failure:` note. The validator must be a reusable module (`skill-generation-validation-tools/tests/harness/question_validator.py`) importable by both generation scripts. Validation statistics (total generated, auto-rewritten, flagged for review) must be printed at the end of each generation run.
- REQ-F-047: Each domain test case file must be expanded to **≥ 100 test cases** using `generator.py` to sample real property values from the live database and generate question stubs via Claude. New cases must cover a wider variety of patterns not already represented: aggregations (GROUP BY equivalents, percentiles, window-style ranking), temporal queries (date ranges, durations, recency filters), multi-hop path traversal (3+ hops, variable-length, shortest path), write operations (MERGE upsert, CREATE, DELETE/DETACH DELETE), admin/schema introspection (SHOW INDEXES, SHOW CONSTRAINTS, SHOW PROCEDURES), plugin-specific patterns (GDS streaming + write-back, APOC utilities, GenAI similarity — where the domain's `capabilities:` list supports them), and edge-case robustness (questions that intentionally produce 0 rows, questions requiring OPTIONAL MATCH, questions with large result sets requiring LIMIT). All questions must follow the business-user language rule (no graph labels, rel-types, or Cypher in the question text). All new cases must pass harness validation (Gates 1–4) at ≥ 90% per domain. Each domain is handled as a separate task (task-057 through task-066) to allow independent progress tracking.
- REQ-F-038: Test coverage must expand to 10 structurally distinct Neo4j database domains. Each new domain requires: a `dataset:` YAML section (schema, connection, description, notes), ≥ 25 test cases across all 5 difficulty tiers, and harness validation against a live database. The full list of domains must be documented in the PRD. Candidate domains from demo.neo4jlabs.com include: `northwind` (retail ERP, relational-to-graph), `stackoverflow` (Q&A tag network), `neoflix` (streaming catalogue variant), `movies` (movie cast/crew), `airports` (transportation network), `twitter` / `github` (social graph), and any additional local instances. Each new domain must demonstrate a distinct graph shape and query pattern not already covered by the existing 3 domains.

- REQ-F-035: Each domain case file must include a set of value-enriched test questions that use concrete entity names, enum values, and ranges drawn from the `dataset:` schema rather than generic placeholders. A subset (≤ 30%) of questions per domain must be phrased in casual business-user language that requires the skill to perform value translation (e.g., "show me all flagged accounts" rather than "MATCH where status='flagged'"; "which high-severity alerts are still open" rather than "severity='high' AND status='open'"). These questions test the skill's value normalization and vocabulary translation capability without replacing the majority of existing technical test cases.

- REQ-NF-011: ≥ 60% of expert-difficulty test cases must pass on first attempt across all domains
- REQ-NF-012: The validation suite must cover ≥ 3 structurally distinct Neo4j database domains (knowledge graph, bipartite rating graph, transaction fraud graph) to verify skill generalizability across different graph shapes and query patterns

### SKILL.md Section Budget (L2)

| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| When NOT to use this skill | 5 | Disambiguation |
| Autonomous Operation Protocol | 20 | Non-negotiable defaults |
| Cypher 25 Version Pragma | 10 | Always emit; CYPHER 5 compat use case |
| Schema-First Protocol | 30 | 5 inspection queries + APOC detection |
| Parameter Discipline | 10 | $param always; why |
| Core Pattern Cheat Sheet | 80 | MERGE, QPE, WITH, WHEN, SEARCH |
| Deprecated Syntax → Preferred | 15 | Old → new mapping table |
| FOREACH vs UNWIND | 10 | Decision rule |
| USE clause | 8 | Multi-database routing |
| Query Construction Decision Tree | 25 | Drives L3 selection |
| EXPLAIN / PROFILE Validation Loop | 30 | dbHits, rows, memory, time |
| Failure Recovery Patterns | 40 | 0-results, TypeError, timeout |
| WebFetch Escalation | 20 | Which URL, when |
| **Total** | **~303** | At budget |

### Schema Inspection Protocol

```cypher
-- 1. Graph topology
CALL db.schema.visualization() YIELD nodes, relationships RETURN nodes, relationships;

-- 2. Available indexes
SHOW INDEXES YIELD name, type, labelsOrTypes, properties, state
WHERE state = 'ONLINE' RETURN name, type, labelsOrTypes, properties;

-- 3. Constraints
SHOW CONSTRAINTS YIELD name, type, labelsOrTypes, properties
RETURN name, type, labelsOrTypes, properties;

-- 4/5. Property names + types — APOC preferred (fast on large graphs)
-- Detection (never throws):
SHOW PROCEDURES WHERE name = 'apoc.meta.schema'
YIELD name RETURN count(name) > 0 AS apocAvailable;

-- Preferred (APOC available):
CALL apoc.meta.schema() YIELD value RETURN value;

-- Fallback (no APOC — slow on large graphs):
CALL db.schema.nodeTypeProperties()
YIELD nodeLabels, propertyName, propertyTypes, mandatory
RETURN nodeLabels, propertyName, propertyTypes, mandatory;

CALL db.schema.relTypeProperties()
YIELD relType, propertyName, propertyTypes, mandatory
RETURN relType, propertyName, propertyTypes, mandatory;
```

### L3 Reference Files

Files are organized by query category — agents should pre-filter at L2 to load only the relevant folder.

| Folder | File | When Loaded | Key Sources |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read/` | `cypher25-patterns.md` | Variable-length paths, QPEs, match modes | `patterns/` adocs |
| `read/` | `cypher25-functions.md` | Aggregation, list, string, temporal, spatial, vector | `functions/` adocs |
| `read/` | `cypher25-subqueries.md` | CALL subqueries, COUNT/COLLECT/EXISTS, scope rules | `subqueries/` adocs |
| `read/` | `cypher25-types-and-nulls.md` | Type errors, null propagation, casting, type predicates | `values-and-types/` adocs |
| `write/` | `cypher25-call-in-transactions.md` | CALL IN TRANSACTIONS batching, ON ERROR, concurrency | `subqueries/subqueries-in-transactions.adoc` |
| `schema/` | `cypher25-indexes.md` | SEARCH clause, vector/fulltext, index hints | `indexes/` adocs |
| (root) | `cypher-style-guide.md` | Final output formatting, naming conventions (all categories) | `styleguide.adoc`, `syntax/naming.adoc` |

The split between `read/cypher25-subqueries.md` (CALL subquery, COUNT{}, COLLECT{}, EXISTS{}) and `write/cypher25-call-in-transactions.md` (CALL { ... } IN TRANSACTIONS) is deliberate — the former is a read-pattern expression, the latter is a write batching primitive.

Index type selection table (included in `cypher25-indexes.md`):

| Query predicate | Index type |
|---|---|
| `n.prop = $val`, `IN $list` | RANGE |
| `STARTS WITH`, `CONTAINS`, `ENDS WITH` | TEXT |
| `point.distance(...)` | POINT |
| `SEARCH ... USING FULLTEXT INDEX` | FULLTEXT |
| `SEARCH ... USING VECTOR INDEX` | VECTOR |

### WebFetch Escalation

| Trigger | URL |
|---|---|
| Specific clause semantics | `https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/25/clauses/{clause}/` |
| Function signatures | `https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/25/functions/{type}/` |
| Path query edge cases | `https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/25/patterns/` |

High-priority pages: `merge/`, `with/`, `call-subquery/`, `search/`, `aggregating/`, `use/`

### PROFILE Metrics (Gate 4)

```
dbHits            — storage engine calls (WARN > expected, FAIL > expected × 10)
rows              — actual processed rows per operator (reliable; use over EXPLAIN estimates)
allocatedMemory   — bytes (WARN > 100MB, FAIL > expected × 5)
elapsedTimeMs     — wall time (WARN > expected, guidance only — CI environments vary)
```

### Git Submodules

| Local path | Upstream (verify before adding) | Tracks |
|---|---|---|
| `docs-cypher/` | `neo4j/docs-cypher-manual` | Neo4j 25 / 2026.x tag |
| `docs-cheat-sheet/` | `neo4j/docs-cypher-cheat-sheet` | Neo4j 25 / 2026.x tag |

### GH Action Design

Trigger: monthly schedule (`cron: '0 8 1 * *'`) + manual dispatch with optional `target_tag` input.

Steps: checkout with submodules → detect latest tag → update submodules → run extraction script → detect missing sections → update VERSION → generate changelog summary → diff check → create PR with diff stat + changelog + `breaking-change` label if any WARNING notices found.

PR is created but **never auto-merged** — human must review content correctness.

### Test Harness Architecture

**Gate sequence per test case:**
```
Gate 1: Syntax       EXPLAIN {query}    → CypherSyntaxError = FAIL
Gate 2: Correctness  Execute            → rows < min_results = FAIL
Gate 3: Quality      Parse EXPLAIN plan → deprecated operators / syntax = FAIL
                                        → missing CYPHER 25 pragma = WARN
Gate 4: Performance  PROFILE            → dbHits, rows, allocatedMemory, elapsedTimeMs
                                        → WARN / FAIL per threshold
```

Write queries execute in an explicit transaction that is always rolled back for test isolation.

**Question generator property sampling** (uses COLLECT subquery with LIMIT — stops early, does not build full list before slicing):

```cypher
MATCH (n:Organization)
RETURN 'Organization' AS label, 'name' AS property,
       COLLECT { MATCH (m:Organization)
                 WHERE m.name IS NOT NULL
                 RETURN DISTINCT m.name LIMIT 100 } AS samples,
       count { (m:Organization) WHERE m.name IS NOT NULL } AS nonNullCount
```

Inferred semantics from samples drive question generation:
- UUID → equality only; integer range → range queries; float 0–1 → threshold; low-cardinality string → IN list; free text → fulltext/CONTAINS; high null rate → IS NOT NULL guards.

**Test case baselines** auto-captured at generation time via PROFILE on candidate Cypher, stored with tolerance multipliers: result count ×[0.5, 10], dbHits ×3, memory ×3, runtime ×5.

### WebFetch as First-Class Knowledge Source

SKILL.md must frame WebFetch as a proactive option, not a fallback. The instruction in the WebFetch Escalation section must read:

> **WebFetch is always available for online agents.** Do not wait until L3 reference files are insufficient — fetch Neo4j docs pages proactively whenever a query involves syntax you are not fully certain about. L3 reference files are token-budget-truncated (≤2,000 tokens each); the full docs pages contain the complete picture.

The section budget for WebFetch Escalation (20 lines) must include this framing up front before the URL table.

### Training Dataset

Every test case that passes all four validation gates is exported as a YAML training record. Format:

```yaml
# skill-generation-validation-tools/tests/dataset/companies.yml  (one file per database domain)
records:
  - id: "companies-TC001-20260319"
    question: "Find the names of the first 10 organizations in the graph"
    database: companies
    neo4j_version: "2026.02"
    schema_context:
      labels: [Organization, Article, Chunk, Person]
      relationship_types: [MENTIONS, HAS_CHUNK, ACTED_IN]
      indexes:
        - {name: entity, type: FULLTEXT, labels: [Organization], properties: [name]}
        - {name: news, type: VECTOR, labels: [Chunk], properties: [embedding]}
    property_samples:
      Organization.name:
        samples: ["Neo4j", "Google", "Microsoft"]
        inferred_semantic: freetext
        non_null_count: 4821
      Organization.id:
        samples: ["neo4j", "google", "microsoft"]
        inferred_semantic: enum
        non_null_count: 4821
    cypher: |
      CYPHER 25
      MATCH (o:Organization)
      RETURN o.name AS name
      LIMIT 10
    metadata:
      difficulty: basic
      tags: [match, labels, return, limit]
      db_hits: 42
      allocated_memory_bytes: 8192
      runtime_ms: 3
      passed_gates: [syntax, correctness, quality, performance]
      generated_at: "2026-03-19T22:45:00Z"
```

The YAML dataset serves three purposes:
1. **Fine-tuning source**: convert to JSONL via `skill-generation-validation-tools/scripts/to_jsonl.py`
2. **Few-shot example store**: retrieve by difficulty/tags for prompt augmentation
3. **Regression baseline**: re-run queries against future Neo4j versions to detect regressions

JSONL output format (per record, one line):
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "<skill instructions summary>"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Database: companies\nSchema: ...\nQuestion: Find the names of the first 10 organizations"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "CYPHER 25\nMATCH (o:Organization)\nRETURN o.name AS name\nLIMIT 10"}
  ]
}
```

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---|---|
| GQL clauses: LET, FINISH, FILTER, NEXT, INSERT | Syntactic rewrites — confusing without added value |
| Admin Cypher: SHOW DATABASES, ALTER USER, privileges | Covered by neo4j-cli-tools-skill |
| Driver API code | Covered by neo4j-migration-skill |
| Cypher 4.x / 5.x migration guidance | Covered by neo4j-cypher-skill |
| Auto-merging the GH Action PR | Human review gate required for content correctness |
| Full Cypher manual inlined as L2 | 291k words violates L2 token budget; use WebFetch escalation |

## Open Questions

1. **Upstream submodule URLs**: Verify exact GitHub org/repo for `docs-cypher` and `docs-cheat-sheet` before `git submodule add` (likely `neo4j/docs-cypher-manual` and `neo4j/docs-cypher-cheat-sheet`).
2. **Tag naming convention**: Do upstream repos tag by Neo4j version (`2026.02`), Cypher version (`25`), or branch-per-version? Determines tag-detection logic in the GH Action.
3. **GH Action secrets**: Is `GITHUB_TOKEN` sufficient for submodule access to public upstream repos, or is a PAT needed?
4. **Test database secrets**: `companies` and `recommendations` demo DBs are public (no secrets, credentials == database name). The `ucfraud` local instance (`bolt://localhost`, `neo4j`/`password`) is developer-local — not deployed to CI without additional configuration. Local tests run via environment variables; CI can use demo.neo4jlabs.com/ucfraud (read-only) for structural validation and gate 1–3 checks, with gate 4 (PROFILE) and write queries requiring the local instance.
5. **Claude Code headless invocation**: Confirm exact CLI pattern for skill-scoped execution in the test runner.
6. **`deprecated_operators.json` maintenance**: Manually updated per release, or auto-generated by `extract-changelog.py`?
7. **Extraction script language**: Python assumed — confirm vs Node.js (a `package.json` exists in `docs-cheat-sheet/`).
