# Neo4j Agent Skills

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) designed to help AI agents work effectively with Neo4j graph databases.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are a standardized format for providing AI agents with domain-specific knowledge and capabilities. They enable agents to perform specialized tasks more effectively by bundling:

- **Instructions** - Step-by-step guidance for accomplishing specific tasks
- **References** - Detailed documentation that agents can access when needed
- **Scripts** - Executable code for automation

Skills follow a progressive disclosure pattern, loading only what's needed to minimize context usage while maximizing effectiveness. For the complete specification, visit [agentskills.io/specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
